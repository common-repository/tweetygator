TweetyGator aggregates tweets from persons, hashtags or keywords you specify

== Description ==

TweetyGator is an aggregator for Twitter. It's possible to show in a widget, a mix of one or more of these:

*   Users
*   Hashtags
*   Keywords

Any combination is possible, as long as the twitter API doesn't reject it.

TweetyGator comes in handy, if you own a blog about a specific subject or if you have a corporate blog. You can then configure TweetyGator to show tweets within your range of interest.

TweetyGator is highly configurable. Either via the administration section of the blog, or by customizing the display template for the front of your blog.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
